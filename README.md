# Overview

## Features

## Syntax Validation

This crate is not intended to provide syntax validation.  
If you are looking to validate your SPF record. I would suggest you use one of the following.

1. [VamSoft.com](https://vamsoft.com/support/tools/spf-syntax-validator)
2. [Spf-Record.com](https://www.spf-record.com/analyzer)

I am sure there are many others that could be found.
